## Project Description
While online learning platforms like Coursera have made education more accessible, they often lack intelligent features to help students effectively process information. Students usually encounter vast amounts of content in video lectures, making it challenging to review, identify key concepts, and pinpoint knowledge gaps. A hierarchical summarizer that presents lecture content at different levels of granularity can significantly aid students in their learning journey.

The proposed project aligns with the "Intelligent Learning Platform" track, as it leverages intelligent information retrieval, natural language processing, and machine learning. Specifically, the application of text-based information systems, retrieval models, and clustering, which are covered in our class, can offer personalized learning support by generating dynamic lecture summaries tailored to individual student needs.
